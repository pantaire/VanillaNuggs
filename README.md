# VanillaNuggs

## how to use
just type in a number - the rest will be done by dark nugg magic. 

## what it does
based on your input number, the algorithm will be calculating different constellations on how to reach your wanted amount of nuggs (chicken nuggets, i should clarify) based on 
1. accuracy to reach precisely your number
2. price
3. amount of dips
4. ease of ordering (e.g. 3 x 20 nuggs instead of 3 x 6 + 4 x 9 + some more cause nobody got time for maths these days)

## versions
0.1 current: in development

## planned extensions: 
1. nicer user interface. current is plain bootstrap with custom colours, generated by https://coolors.co.

2. add graphs from echarts to visualize nugg/dip/price distributions
2.1. turn the whole thing into a giant dahboard with stuff like colourcoded accuracy bars

3. add possibility to change prices and dipcounts - maybe even currencies. or get rid of currencies, preferably worldwide. ain't nothing but problems.
