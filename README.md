# VanillaNuggs
Nuggs. with plain JS (juice sauce, not to be confused with javascript)

# how to use
just type in a number - the rest will be calculated in some kind of dark nugg magic. 

# what it do
based on your input number, the algorithm will be calculating different constellations on how to reach your wanted amount of nuggs (chicken nuggets, i should clarify) based on 
1. accuracy to reach your number
2. price
3. amount of dips
4. ease of ordering (e.g. 3 x 20 nuggs instead of 3 x 6 + 4 x 9 + some more cause nobody got time for maths these days)

# versions
0.1 current: in development

# planned extensions: 
1. add graphs from echarts to visualize nugg/dip/price distributions
2. nicer user interface. current is plain bootstrap.
3. add ability to change prices and dipcounts - maybe even currencies. or get rid of currencies. ain't nothing but problems.
